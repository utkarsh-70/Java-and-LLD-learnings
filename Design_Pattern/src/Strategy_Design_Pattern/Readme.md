Strategy Design Pattern – Crux
1. What It Is

The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It separates the algorithm’s implementation from the class that uses it, enabling dynamic changes in behavior without modifying the client code.

The pattern is based on composition over inheritance.

The client (context) interacts with a strategy interface or abstract class, not with concrete implementations.

2. Motivation / Why It Exists

Imagine a class with multiple ways of performing an operation (e.g., different payment methods or sorting algorithms).

Without Strategy Pattern:

You would likely use conditional logic (if-else or switch-case).

Adding a new behavior requires modifying the original class, breaking the Open/Closed Principle (OCP).

Changing existing behavior can introduce bugs—this is called the fragile base class problem.

With Strategy Pattern:

Each algorithm is encapsulated in its own class.

The context class can switch algorithms dynamically at runtime.

Client code remains unaffected by changes or additions to the algorithms.

3. Structure / Key Components

Strategy Interface / Abstract Class

Defines a common method signature for all algorithms.

Ensures the client can interact with any algorithm interchangeably.

Concrete Strategies

Implement the Strategy interface.

Provide specific behavior for the algorithm.

Can have shared code in an abstract class if needed.

Context

Maintains a reference to a Strategy object.

Delegates the task to the chosen strategy instead of implementing it directly.

Can change strategies at runtime to adapt behavior.

4. What Happens Without It

Without the Strategy Pattern:

The context class might contain multiple if-else statements or subclasses for every variation.

Modifying an algorithm requires changing the original class, which may break existing functionality.

Extending behavior is hard, violating Open/Closed Principle.

Maintenance becomes cumbersome and error-prone.

Example consequence: Adding a new payment method would require changing the ShoppingCart class directly, potentially introducing bugs in existing payment methods.

5. Advantages

Flexibility: Switch behavior dynamically at runtime.

Encapsulation: Algorithm implementation is hidden from the client.

Extensibility: New algorithms can be added without modifying existing code.

Adheres to SOLID principles: Especially OCP (Open/Closed) and SRP (Single Responsibility).

6. Considerations / Pitfalls

Too many small classes: Every new algorithm is a new class, which can lead to class explosion.

Clients must know which strategy to use: Deciding which strategy to pick may require extra logic.

Overhead: Using interfaces or abstract classes adds a small runtime overhead for delegation.

7. Real-World Examples

Payment systems: Credit Card, PayPal, UPI, Cash – all interchangeable without changing the shopping cart logic.

Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort – select the strategy based on dataset size or type.

Compression algorithms: ZIP, RAR, GZIP – compress files using different strategies dynamically.

Logging: Console logging, file logging, remote logging – switch behavior without touching client code.

8. When to Use

When you have multiple algorithms for a specific task and want to choose dynamically.

When you want to replace complex conditional statements with polymorphism.

When you want to adhere to SOLID principles, especially OCP and SRP.

When your algorithms may evolve independently over time.

9. Summary

The Strategy Design Pattern allows you to write flexible, maintainable, and extensible code by encapsulating algorithms and delegating behavior to interchangeable objects. It solves the fragile base class problem, avoids rigid inheritance hierarchies, and supports runtime adaptability.

Think of it as a plug-and-play system for behavior: the context only cares about what to do, not how it’s done.
