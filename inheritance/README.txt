Project: Inheritance Example in Java

Description:
This project demonstrates the concept of inheritance in Java using a simple
example of vehicles. It shows how a parent class (Vehicle) can be extended
by child classes (Car and Bike) to reuse and extend functionality.

Files:
1. Vehicle.java  - Parent class containing common attributes (brand, year).
2. Car.java      - Child class of Vehicle with an additional attribute (doors).
3. Bike.java     - Child class of Vehicle with an additional attribute (cc rating).
4. Main.java     - Driver class with the main() method to create objects
                   of Car and Bike, and display their details.

Objective:
The objective of this program is to:
- Demonstrate the concept of inheritance in Java.
- Show how child classes can extend a parent class.
- Illustrate code reusability and organization using inheritance.
