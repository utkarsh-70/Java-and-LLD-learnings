Abstraction is the process of showing only necessary details rather than its implementation.
It tells us what is done rather than how it is done.
In other words we can get to use the functionality rather than knowing its internal working.

There are two ways to achieve abstraction:-
1.Abstract classes-We can achive abstraction from 0-100% by the use of abstract methods which work as contract.
We can also have concrete methods in abstract classes which can be overridden.
It can also have instance variables which get instatiated when we create its subclass and instatiate it using super method.
2.Interfaces-It is pure abstraction where there is no implementation of any method.
